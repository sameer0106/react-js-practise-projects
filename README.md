# React Practice Projects

This repository contains React applications built while learning modern frontend development concepts.

The goal of these projects is to gain hands-on experience with:
- Component-based architecture
- React Hooks
- State management
- Event handling
- Reusable UI components
- Routing
- Basic application structure

These projects are part of my journey toward building full-stack web applications.
